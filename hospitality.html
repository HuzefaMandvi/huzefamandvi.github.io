					<h2> Hospitality </h2>
					<p> It was early afternoon in Borneo when Cameron and I emerged from the magnificent Fairy Caves. After a morning of trekking and orangutan sighting, we were exhausted and starving (having skipped breakfast in order to make the morning bus). We had taken a Grab (Southeast Asian variant of Uber) from the orangutan sanctuary to the caves, and so we figured we would take one back to the city to rest and find a meal. Instead, the app notified me that Grab did not serve this area, sorry for any inconvenience caused. There were no taxis to be found - in fact, there wasn't much of anything but a blank expanse of road stretching for kilometers in both directions away from the caves. After some discussion, we decided to just start walking in one direction until we found, well, something.
					<br>
					<br>
					This was perhaps the first time in my 4 month adventure that I truly had no idea what would happen next. We wandered aimlessly, not knowing what to expect. Luckily it was an overcast day, so we were given mercy from the generally unrelenting Bornean sun. We walked for some time, finding smiles on the faces of a few locals but not much else. Finally, after a few kilometers, we happened upon a small restaurant/grocery store called the Thistle Cafe. We sat wearily, silent except for our food orders, thankful that we had found somewhere to sit and eat.
					<br>
					<br>
					After wolfing down our first meal of the day, we asked the owner of the restaurant if it was possible to get a taxi or bus here. She explained, "taxi no come here, have to go town to take bus". "Town" referred to Bau, which was 9km away. Our hearts momentarily sank, as we realized we would have a hell of a trek in order to get there before it got dark. She continued, after a slight pause, "you come with me!". We protested, but she said she was headed into town anyways to pick up some things for the restaurant. She pulled her car out front, and we piled into the backseat.
					<br>
					<br>
					5 hours after we had left the Fairy Caves, we finally reached the Bau. She dropped us off at a strip mall parking lot, and directed us towards a ticketing booth. "There can take bus to Kuching", and with that she was off. I didn't even have time to get a picture or express my gratitude properly. We bought our bus tickets, and before long we too were off - in a rickety ancient bus with a bulletproof steel frame, headed back towards Kuching. Thank goodness for Southern (Eastern Asian) hospitality. </p>
