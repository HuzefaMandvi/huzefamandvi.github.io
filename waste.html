					<h2> Waste </h2>
					<p> From the volcanic crater of Lake Toba to the Railay Beach, I noticed a strange juxtaposition of beauty and ugliness. A backdrop of sweeping rock formations and jade oceans was obscured by heaps of trash. Floating masses of plastic bags and straws swam in the same waters as coral reefs and manta rays. Cigarette butts intermix into fields of orchids. I was particularly struck when my good friend Cameron informed me of his decision to stop using plastic straws. Coffee comes in a perfectly good cup with an opening at the top - do we really need a tube of plastic to transfer liquid the ~3.5 inches up to our mouth? Is this what thousands of years of evolution has culminated in? So I decided to join Cameron in this strawless venture, this quest to stop sucking, as it were. Humans consume plastic at an exorbitant and unsustainable rate, and I fear that we are quickly approaching the straw that will break the Earth's back - <a href="https://thelastplasticstraw.org/" target="_blank">the last straw</a>. Puns aside, this one small change has led to many other small changes in my life.
					<br>
					<br>
					An avalanche is just the culmination of many (many, many) individual snowflakes, and as more join it gains momentum and power. So, friends, I humbly ask that you join me in trying to reduce our impact on our beautiful planet. Use reusable water bottles! Buy used clothes! And once your clothes are past their usable life, don't just throw them out - use them as rags around the house! Try to use minimal plastic bags, but when you do get them, save 'em! Bring a plastic bag every time you go into nature and fill it with all the trash you see along the way. 
					<br>
					<br>
					At times it feels hopeless, when you consider how small the impact of an individual is compared to the toll that big corporations can have on the environment. But we cannot let this fact become a demotivational factor. When you pick up a piece of trash from a hiking trail, you have a direct and tangible impact on the beauty and the quality of that area. Feel empowered my friends! Together, we can leave the world a more beautiful place so that future generations can continue to enjoy the great outdoors. </p>
