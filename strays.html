					<h2> Strays </h2>
					<p> After a few months abroad, you begin to miss certain things from back home - things like a quiet blanket of snow, being surrounded by your loved ones, and Chipotle. So on our second day in Cambodia, we decided to dine at a Mexican restaurant in the heart of Siem Reap. Yep, I truly thrived while abroad.
					<br>
					<br>
					The place was run by a tall white dude, who had quit his well-paying software job in Silicon Valley to seek a simpler and more fulfilling life. He sat and talked with us while we ate, sharing wisdom and the experience of living in Siem Reap as an ex-pat. As we chatted, a grizzled brown dog entered the restaurant and trotted over to us. I fully expected him to shoo the dog away, as I had seen so many people do throughout Southeast Asia. Instead I was pleasantly surprised to learn that he was an adopted pet, lovingly given the name "Taco" and given the freedom to roam around the city as he pleased. The owner told us how he had adopted Taco after seeing him sulking hungrily in the streets. Our conversation soon turned to stray animals, and how to care for them. The owner revealed that he had chosen to not neuter Taco, as he felt that he had no right to mutilate a wild animal.
					<br>
					<br>
					Southeast Asia is littered with strays, mostly cats, who skulk about in every dark corner of every city. They scrounge trash bins for thrown out food, and make homes underneath cars and in abandoned buildings (such as the adorable kittens at the Ta Som temple in Angkor Wat, pictured left). A select few are lucky enough to be adopted by a family or a shop, given food or water and maybe a place to stay. For the vast majority, however, strays live tough and all-too-often short lives. Given this, do we (as humans) have a responsibility to lessen their suffering by reducing the number of strays? How can we let these animals continue to reproduce, given the high probability that their offspring will live hungry and tired, fighting for scraps? These were the questions that plagued me, but I refrained from asking the owner directly. Many others have had the same thoughts, and there are dozens of organizations across Southeast Asia that spay and neuter stray animals in order to reduce their numbers - to spay the stray away, as it were.
					<br>
					<br>
					I thought about this for weeks, and the owner's words kept echoing in my head. On one hand, I believe that we have a responsibility to reduce suffering of other beings. But should we have a say in the reproductive abilities of a wild animal? Animals live to successfully breed - that's, like, their whole shtick. Who are we as humans to deny them that? Should we just let natural selection run its course on stray animals, even if it means more suffering?
