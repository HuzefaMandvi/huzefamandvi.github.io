					<h2> Solitude // Disconnect </h2>
					<p> One of my personal goals for my semester abroad was to learn to be alone without feeling lonely (an important distinction which, in my opinion, is all too often not recognized). One of my biggest fears was not finding any friends in Singapore. I was blessed to find a pretty cool group of folks on my first day, but still found myself alone pretty often. Feelings of loneliness are a normal human response to solitude, but I think they are magnified by things like social media and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out" target="_blank">FOMO</a>. I think we can all benefit from distinguishing "alone" from "lonely" and learning to be with ourselves and in the moment, rather than thinking about where we aren't and who we aren't with.
					<br>
					<br>
					To that end, I decided to travel solo on two occasions (Kuala Lumpur and Ao Nang). On both occasions, I did not access the internet except at my hostel. While I was disconnected from the world, I felt more connected than ever to my immediate surroundings. I'm usually buried in my phone, with headphones in to block out the noise of the outside world and unsolicited conversations. However, disconnecting forced me to become more mindful and appreciative of the little things - the din of bustling markets, the juicy savoriness of fresh seared prawns, <a href="images/disconnect.jpg" target="_blank">the quiet silhouette of palm trees against the quickly darkening night sky</a>. 
					<br>
					<br>
					At times I felt more lonely than ever, knowing that I had no way to communicate with anyone. In this level of removedness from peers, you begin to realize how little and insignificant you are in the grand scheme of things. I have heard many describe this feeling (known as <a href="https://creativesystemsthinking.wordpress.com/2014/12/13/yugen-%E5%B9%BD%E7%8E%84-deep-awareness-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">Yugen</a> in Japanese) as stressful because their actions hold no importance. I personally find it to be incredibly soothing. Our impossibly intricate lives are insignificant. Our failures, our triumphs, our loves, our griefs. They will quickly fade into irrelevancy as the uncaring universe marches forward. Except you'll still lie awake in bed late at night, remembering that time you called the teacher "mom" in 2nd grade and everyone laughed at you. Some things never change... </p>
