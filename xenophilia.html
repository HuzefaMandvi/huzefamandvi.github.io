					<h2> Xenophilia </h2>
					<p> Throughout my travels, I happened upon many a group of giggling locals who stared shyly at my friends and me. Without fail, the bravest among them would approach us with a huge grin and ask for a picture with one or all of us. This strange phenomenon was not localized to one country or culture - it happened almost everywhere I went. At first, I cynically believed that we were being made fun of; that the locals were mocking us <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ang_mo" target="_blank">ang moh</a>. However, I soon realized that people were not laughing at us, but rather they were fascinated to see people different from themselves.
					<br>
					<br>
					In today's social and political scenes, we are reminded that xenophobia is far from gone and there is so much progress still to be made. Yet it is important to remember the other, more optimistic side of this coin. I was lucky to meet so many xenophilic people - people who love the unknown, who were so excited to meet someone from a different place that they approached me for a picture in the same way one might approach a celebrity. And once we agreed to a picture, it was like we were all best friends - laughing together while trying to communicate via charade-esque gesturing. Soon we would part ways, but for a brief beautiful moment in a tumultuous world, two entities were united by only chance and a seething curiosity/love for the unknown.
					<br>
					<br>
					My own negative attitude towards people held me back from seeing the beauty of xenophilia. Perhaps we should always assume the best in others. </p>
