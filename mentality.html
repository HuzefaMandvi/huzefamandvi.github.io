					<h2> Mentality </h2>
					<p> Everyone knows that hard work pays off, but often this tenet is not actually ingrained in our mentality. On a van ride back from a mountaintop Buddhist temple in Vietnam, my sister explained the difference between a <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/" target="_blank">growth vs fixed mentality</a> to me. I don't remember what brought this up, but I will remember the lessons she imparted for my whole life.
					<br>
					<br>
					My fixed mentality told me that if I could not do something, then that failure reflected on me as a person and I was unable to do anything about it. This mentality assumes that I should be able to do everything, and if I cannot succeed at something right now then there is no way that I will ever be able to. And thus, I have failed - only serving to generate a negative feedback loop which discourages trying anything challenging or different.
					<br>
					<br>
					A growth mentality, on the other hand, would use that failure as an opportunity to identify a weakness and bring about a change to strengthen it. I believe that many of my peers share my fixed mindset, and it stems from what we are taught is valuable. I, like many others, was taught that results were what mattered - I needed to achieve high grades and high test scores in order to be a successful person. From my parents' perspective, this makes total sense. For them, test scores and high grades were paramount to a successful career and thus a good life - these were their values, which are shared by so many American immigrants. And for them, these values did correlate with success. But a growth mentality values hard work and self-improvement over results, allowing for failure to be a stepping stone rather than a road block. A growth mentality knows that intelligence and personality can be developed, rather than being ingrained in onesself. It follows the mantra, "Don't let perfect be the enemy of good".
					<br>
					<br>
					Enter rock climbing. As a kid, I was never successful at sports - I tried many, was not initially good at them, and quickly gave up (fixed mentality). In September 2017, Kayla introduced me to rock climbing and I initially responded the same way. I was too weak, could barely climb a few easy routes, and wanted to give up. But she pushed me to keep trying, and I started to slowly notice improvements - I was getting stronger and my technique was improving, and as soon as I noticed this my motivation to climb skyrocketed. I started to climb more and more, and for once I was not discouraged by initial failure but actually motivated by it. 
					<br>
					<br>
					I'm still a piss-poor climber, but I continue to work hard and try to get better. I look at the best climbers in the world and say "I want to be like them, how can I achieve that?" where before I might murmur "I can never be like them, might as well give up now." And I know this lesson sounds pretty stupid and cliche, but it truly has changed my perspective on life. </p>
