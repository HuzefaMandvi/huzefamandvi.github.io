					<h2> Food </h2>
					<p> After 20 hours of travel time, I arrived wearily at NUS and went straight to the food court. My first meal in Singapore was roasted duck noodle; tender, succulent filets of duck breast, sauteed with notes of sweet and spicy, cradled by a pillow of perfectly cooked rice noodles, topped with a generous dashing of spring onions. Over the next 5 months, I tried enough delicious food to justify a whole different website dedicated to my culinary exploits. Standouts include Malaysian Nasi Ayam Goreng, Thai Panang Curry, Vietnamese Banh Mi (pictured left), and Singaporean Chai Tow Kway.
					<br>
					<br>
					Every street corner in Singapore is jam packed with food stalls. In sprawling hawker centers, restaranteurs peddle everything from pad thai to paninis. And while many sell similar dishes, this does not stop people from going to great lengths just to eat their preferred variant. I routinely travelled 30 minutes from campus and waited in a long queue just to have my favorite Nasi Lemak (even though there were several stalls that sold the dish, most with no queue at all!). People are passionate about their favorites, and will often get in heated debates over the city's best Chicken Rice or why this stall's version of Hokkien Mee is inauthentic. Don't even get me started on the <a href="http://www.angmohdan.com/how-to-order-kopi/" target="_blank">various ways to order coffee (Kopi)</a>.
					<br>
					<br>
					This passion is mirrored in the chefs behind the meals. They will wake up early, get the freshest ingredients from the local markets, and sometimes literally carry their product on their back across a city. Aunties at Singaporean hawker centers cheerfully toil in hot, cramped kitchens, frantically serving up dishes for a ravenous crowd. Uncles relay your order to the back kitchen and greet you with a smile. In Krabi, you find people selling Pad Thai and fresh fish out of <a href="images/boatfood.jpg" target="_blank">small canoes</a> in floating markets, or <a href="images/longtail.jpg" target="_blank">longtail boats</a> parked right on Railay Beach. In the chaotic city of Bangkok, street food vendors beckon to you, insisting that their satay is the best in town, you just <i>have</i> to try it. And with street food and hawker center meals as cheap as 1 USD, why not? </p>
