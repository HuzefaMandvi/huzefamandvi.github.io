					<h2> Village Life </h2>
					<p> On my last day in Cambodia, I had the opportunity to spend some time at Kok Dong Village. I was shown around by a warmhearted man sporting a bright pink shirt named Sorn, who proudly explained the daily life in the village. People get up early in the morning to work in the rice paddies before the day grows too hot, they grind the rice by hand, care for chickens and cows. We made the short hike to a dry empty field, where Sorn taught me to seek out the cherry-sized holes in the ground that indicated the presence of a crab. Using a metal hoe, I successfully dug up several crabs and tried in vain to not get pinched. He also taught me how to fish using only a weighted net, and together we caught dozens of <a href="images/fish.jpg" target="_blank">tiny silver fish</a>.
					<br>
					<br>
					We brought our haul of fish and crab across the arid field under the scorching midday sun. As we stopped to rest under the shade of a lone tree, Sorn explained that the ground we stood on was once part of the massive Ang Kor temple complex. We stood in the outer ring, no longer a recognizable temple complex, but the scattered ruins of temples and the moats were still visible. We made our way back to the village, where I was introduced to Sorn's wife and children who eyed me shyly. Sorn proudly displayed the basket half-full of our spoils to his wife, and she quickly got to work slicing and filleting. We sat together in the shade of the courtyard, eating the fresh fish and crab with papaya salad and rice with our hands. We sat in silence for a long while, taking in the empty quietness around us. Before long, I was on my way back to the hostel on the back of Sorn's loud old motorcycle.
					<br>
					<br>
					I noticed that Sorn spoke surprisingly good English - he explained that he was one of the lucky ones.  Most people in the village spoke little to no English, and this was a major barrier to finding a good job. Siem Reap, the nearest city, is dominated by tourism and thus if you can speak English, you're guaranteed a decent well-paying job. To that end, Sorn founded a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bfokschool/missionstatement" target="_blank">school</a> in Kok Dong with the goal of providing English education and general education to the local children. He easily could have taken a well-paying job at a hotel or tour company in the city, but decided instead to leverage his English skills and give back to his community. I'm not sure that I would have the same level of selflessness in his scenario - perhaps growing up in a small village instills a sense of loyalty, of depending on and providing for others.  </p>
